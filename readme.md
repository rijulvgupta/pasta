water, large pot, pasta ,salt, tongs, colander, sauce, cheese



Boil water in a large pot To make sure pasta doesn’t stick together, use at least 4 quarts of water for every pound of noodles.

Salt the water with at least a tablespoon—more is fine The salty water adds flavor to the pasta.

Add pasta Pour pasta into boiling water. Don’t break the pasta; it will soften up within 30 seconds and fit into the pot.

Stir the pasta As the pasta starts to cook, stir it well with the tongs so the noodles don’t stick to each other (or the pot).

Test the pasta by tasting it Follow the cooking time on the package, but always taste pasta before draining to make sure the texture is right. Pasta cooked properly should be al dente—a little chewy.

Drain the pasta Drain cooked pasta well in a colander. If serving hot, add sauce right away and put cheese on top
